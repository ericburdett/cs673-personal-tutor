He turned and saw, still red, something that had passed in the shadows.

'But I am not all alone; yet this land is full of others, and we must not speak of them. For there are many still living there; the others are called by names of men. We call them 'the children of Gondor.' And I am the son to Minas Tirith, who is the first to have heard of many things that are not here.

              "[\"You could get away without much trouble \\nwith that.' \\n\\n'I am sure it is no comfort to have to worry about that for \\nmany days,' said Frodo. 'If you could leave the Ring and leave it for \\nmany years, you might at least get away without much trouble.' \\n\\n'I think we shall get away,' said Pippin. 'But there is another burden \\non us. Let's get home before the weather changes.' \\n\\n'All ready to go?' said Frodo. 'We are hungry. What is to be \\ndone?' \\n\\n'Much at least!' said Pippin. 'But we must think about what we are to do. \\n\\nThe hunt was on. The Elves had caught some great birds. We must hunt \\nsome more. There is some dappled wood, and some strange things about it. \\n\\nIt might be better if we could go straight to it.' \\n\\n'Maybe not,' said Frodo. 'But this will be the end of all our planning \\nand our trial of our strength. I think there are some strange things about this \\nwood. It is full of queer things. Some of the Elves seem to have escaped \\nto the North from the holes and holes in the hills. Do you think they may \\nhave made little noise at the news of the hunt, or have been making \\nmore and more noises at the same hollow? \\n\\nWhen we heard that what we had to do was over, the hunt turned \\nsouth, we wandered round again and round again. It is a long way, but it is \\nwell within our means.' \\n\\n'I am sure it is indeed,' said Frodo. 'But I am afraid we cannot go \\nany further this way yet. We have not eaten since the night before; and \\nthe Elves will have something to eat before they are satisfied of our strength \\nand the food we have. We will turn back southwards, I guess; and if we \\nare to go into the South, we must cross the Great River and so try to \\nreach the Black Gate before the night is long lost.' \\n\\n'But the time flies, and the night flies,' said Frodo. 'I think we \\nmust find the North and go straight at last to the Gate. The Silverlode is deep \\nbehind us, but we must try and get there. I think we must throw away our \\npursuit and go straight to the Gate. But I have no desire to do so, not yet \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nexactly. The Enemy is watching, and he has other plans.' \\n\\n'He knows what we are doing,' said Frodo. 'But he cannot use the Ring to \\nwhitewash the Shadow in his own. The sooner we throw away the feather, the \\nbetter.' \\n\\n'You may throw away the feather,' said Pippin. 'It was a long song, and \\nI don't think the Shadow will sing to be merry yet.' \\n\\n'No, I won't,' said Frodo. 'He will not. He knows that.' \\n\\n'Then let us go straight to the Westmarch,' said Pippin. 'Unless we throw away the \\nPursuit, we shall have a hard time at the Gate. We must try and get there. \\n\\nBefore we do that, we must find some way to get across the river. There \\nwe have to find a way, and that way will take us southwards. It will take \\nyears, maybe, to find a path over the Great River.' \\n\\n'It will take years,' said Merry. 'Don't be too gloomy. It will take \\nyears to find the way. We shall have to warm the houses and make beds. There \\nare enough of those things now that we can spare. But we can't do all that \\nwe could, and those are getting harder and harder to find.' \\n\\n'You are as gloomy as a gloomy tree,' said Pippin. 'But I am \\nas gloomy as a tree, you see. It is growing and growing in spite of all that \\nwe have done.' \\n\\n'We have done more than enough,' said Merry. 'It is growing and \\ngrowing fast. I have made a bed for it. But if we go any further this evening, \\nwe shall all be lost.’ \\n\\n'All right! Let us go straight to the right stair! ’ \\n\\nThe door opened and there was Pippin there. He had taken the feather and \\nwand and now immediately he was thrust in. He was alone. All the stones \\n\"]"
